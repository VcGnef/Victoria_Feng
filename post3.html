            <h2>Does carpe diem brings you more excitement than anxiety?</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Carpe diem or seize the day is a Latin phrase that urges people to make most of the present and have less regards to the future.</p>
            <p>Recently, I related with this a lot more. Ever since I was younger, I had a dream of becoming a doctor. It wasn't until of late that I realized that it wasn't a career that I felt truly passionate about.</p>
            <p>So why was I stuck for 10+ years stuck onto this dream? That question took me some time to understand where its origin starts from the beginning of how I was inspired to become one. When I was a lot younger, there was a project that we had to do of finding a career to pursue. As a second generation of immigrants - since my parents were the first - the careers I've seen was quite limited. Out of the limited list, being a doctor seemed the most appealing.</p>
            <p>It was the most appealing for several reasons, (1) my parents saw it as the most stable job for income, (2) the career seems to carry some prestige, (3) I cared about people and want to help them out and (4) due to some neglect from my parents, the only person that seemed to care for me was a doctor. As you might see that out of all of the reasons, only the last one 2 were personal but it was not because I wanted to do it for me. Instead, I wanted to become a doctor to thank that person for their care. I was also obsessed thinking that if I become a doctor, I will be just like them personality-wise. She is meticious, quick-witted, driven and resilient. I wanted that. In summary: I idolized and wrongfully equated those qualities with the career.</p>
            <p>The desire of having those traits did somewhat manifest but I quickly realized that it was the activities that built me as I am rather than having to be in that career. I found that the most important to carpe diem is to pick a career that can execute your strengths the most as well as challenge you to grow along with your weaknesses. I realized that I actually enjoy meeting people, traveling, strategizing and planning. I'm also a curious and innovative person that loves problem-solving via technology. Further thinking about the possbilities through surfing the web, I realized that my strengths can truly thrive in marketing and sales.</p>
            <p>There's always things to learn about other people and the products can be sold creatively to customers, eventually, improving their projects. I find that exciting. Letting go a dream that felt wrong really allowed me to proceed into something suiting.</p>
            <p>It made me thought that perhaps carpe diem would mainly bring anxiety when a goal doesn't align with personal values. When the goal does align with personal values, it can bring in a lot more confidence.</p>
            <p>Hope this helps you if you are still figuring out your career direction.</p>
            <p>See you in the next post.</p>
