            <h2>Do you believe that the most rewarding things come from sufferings?</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>For the longest time, the thought that more sufferings equate to more rewards lived with me. It's true that to gain anything there needs to be a certain amount of input. </p>
            <p>However, I took it way too seriously that I ironically wasn't focused on the things that can build me. Instead, I lost most of my efforts to very low-yielding tasks - caring excessively toward people that don't give the same in return and dramatizing scenarios. It got tiring and eventually it was no longer my work that burnt me out but rather these mental nuances.</p>
            <p>As I dug deeper into a possible root cause, the one that was really overlooked, was myself. Perhaps the sufferings I had were majority self-inflicted. The <i>sufferings</i> don't exist but were excuses for the choices I made. I placed myself in suffocating positions. I allowed toxic people to take over my life when it could be avoided. I also thought situations were more <i>significant</i> than they should be.</p>
            <p>The epiphany lifted a lot of stress because I knew which aspect to change - limiting the unnecessary that no longer serves me.</p>
            <p>I shifted my attention to things that make me fulfilled and making tasks more fulfilling. It was also when I decided to start coding. Ever since I competed in the WISE competition hosted by UofT on machine learning, I had been interested in its application potentials, especially in science. With zero experience, I decided to try out some gateway coding languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C. I found out that the best way to really learn and remember is through creating projects. It is time-consuming but it allows practice and ground concepts.</p>
            <p>I have yet to apply concepts for C but eventually, I would like to share a few projects that are simple calculators for science to double-check lab calculations. As of far, I find that C requires a lot more mathematical knowledge than the web design languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Over time, I would like to produce useful scientific tools. Ideally, I would like to work with wet lab research while I develop the tools with other individuals that are fascinated by scientific development.</p>
            <p>So far, I have been facing an ongoing challenge of becoming more open. I'm quite a reserved person.</p>
            <p>It could be past hurt that made me more protective and untrusting of others. I had been better at it since high school where I avoided making friends. University forced me to interact with others but I wasn't able to find close bonds with other people. I wouldn't say that I'm a complete loner as I do have three close friends that I cherish to death. Although I know that I can't be close friends with everyone that I do meet, I do want to be able to express who I am to them and allow them to be comfortable as well. I would want to work with them and be partners in crime. It is exactly what motivated me to start this blog series because I do want to express myself i.e. exposing myself. I'm also curious about where this can lead me. Some of the most rewarding things are sometimes beyond one's original expectations anyways.</p>
            <p>Not going to lie, it has been hard as I'm so afraid of others' judgment and deception.</p>
            <p>If you're reading this, I wish you all the best and the courage to get over some of your deepest struggles as well.</p>
            <p>See you in the next post.</p>
